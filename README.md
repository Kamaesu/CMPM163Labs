For the first cube on the left it was for part 1 where I just simply changed the material used for the cube. The cube in the middle is the one that is in the example video. The one on the far right is the interpolating cube that is in the example, but the colors are changed. And lastly, the one on the top is the one that is with the new shader, using the fragmentShader2.frag.
